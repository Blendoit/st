* Original README

** Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

** Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into the /usr/local
namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if necessary as
root):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make clean install
#+END_SRC

** Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
tic -sx st.info
#+END_SRC

See the man page for additional details.
